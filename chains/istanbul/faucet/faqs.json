        "description": "An Ethereum faucet is a developer tool to get testnet Ether (ETH) in order to test and troubleshoot your decentralized application or protocol before going live on Ethereum mainnet, where one must use real Ether. Most faucets require social authentication (e.g. Twitter post or login confirming you are a real human) or place you in a queue to wait for a testnet token through the faucet. The Alchemy Sepolia faucet is free, fast, and does not require authentication, though you can optionally login to Alchemy to get an increased drip."

        "title": "What is a testnet token?",
        "description": "Testnet tokens are a test currency that allows you to test your Ethereum application before going live on mainnet. Testnet tokens can be used in place of mainnet Ether tokens on testnets like Sepolia. You can read more here."

        "description": "An Ethereum-based wallet address is 42 characters long including the “0x” at the front. We only support wallets that follow this spec, so please make sure your wallet meets the criteria! We have seen a few users try to put Argent Wallets, but unfortunately we do not support that at this time."

        "description": "The time it takes for you to receive your test tokens may vary! This is because the network may be congested at this time, or the amount of gas we have set for these transactions may be a little low compared to other transactions that miners may choose to validate instead. If it has been over a few hours and you still have not received your testnet tokens, please fill out this form and we will send some!"
